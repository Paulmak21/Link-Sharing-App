# Link-Sharing-App

# About Project
Hi there! I'm Paul and I'm thrilled to share that I've recently embarked on an exciting new journey as a Software Developer, having started just two months ago. At present, I'm collaborating with a fellow student from my coding boot camp on a fascinating project that will showcase our skills and creativity. We're both looking forward to learning as much as possible from this experience and taking our coding abilities to the next level. Hope you like it!

## Tools used
This particular project is focused on a link-sharing app type made with ES6. We made the project from a template we had from this [page]([url](https://www.frontendmentor.io/)https://www.frontendmentor.io/)

Looking forward to accomplishing what we have learned in this course and making interesting apps.
